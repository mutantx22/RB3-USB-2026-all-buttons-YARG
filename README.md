# Updated for 2026 play on YARG:

I Modified the original code so that all buttons are mapped to a MIDI button (in the latest release from 2016 only the keys 
had MIDI events assigned to them, not the dpad/face buttons/overdrive/start/select buttons.
  
issues unresolved/ to fix:

program doesn't work when keyboard is plugged into a USB hub
